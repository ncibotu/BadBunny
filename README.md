For pulling BadBunny Analytics

My Steps:
First Trial.  Pull data in data using Google Apps Script from kworb.net.  Made some charts fiddling with Google Sheets/Looker based on daily import of kworb.net data. Charts there (https://www.datagrow.org/data)

Second Trial.  Want to pull my own data so learning to use Google YouTube API Great Video here (https://youtu.be/TIZRskDMyA4?si=asPVzQfYYB_vO0PG)
